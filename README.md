This is the official PyTorch package for the discrete VAE used for DALL·E. The transformer used to generate the images from the text is not part of this code release.

# Installation

Before running [the example notebook](notebooks/usage.ipynb), you will need to install the package using

	pip install DALL-E

If pip install DALL-E fails to initiate the instalation, try:

	pip3 install DALL-E

Ensure PIP has been added to your PATH variable:

	To check that pip has been added to your PATH variable: Press the Windows key + R to open Run. Type “ cmd “ and then press Enter for the command prompt. For a list of the locations added to your PATH variable, type “ echo %PATH% “ and hit Enter.****
